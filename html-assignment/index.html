            <h3>From dial-up to now</h3>
            <p>I remember dial-up internet with fondness. I was born in Ottawa and lived in a rural area with dial-up for nearly half my life. Loading a website with images took a minute or two and you needed LimeWire for music. Downloading videos was very time consuming.  I eventually moved into the city, first Ottawa, then Montreal. For the latter half of my life, I've been able to bask in very high-speed internet. Although I hated the 28.8 <abbr title="Kilobits Per Second">kbps</abbr> speeds, I'm glad it gave me perspective.</p>
            <h3>My first internet experience</h3>
            <p>I didn't really get internet at first. Around 1996, give or take one or two years, I had my first experience. During the summer, my family went to Rhode Island to visit my aunt. She showed us the internet on her computer. I remember she told me that I can learn anything. She asked me, an eight-year-old, what I would like to know. I wasn't sure what I was getting into, <em>I didn't really get it</em>. Either way, I had recently seen a stick bug, so my mother suggested that. My aunt pulled up Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Encarta and searched for stick bug. There was so much information, I couldn't have read it all. My aunt offered to print it when I looked interested. I went home with a very thick, stapled document about stick bugs that I never looked at again. I'm glad I figured out the point of the internet eventually.</p>

                        <!-- This used to be a footer, then a section element. I changed it from footer to a section element becuase a footer element was a block type element that helped to seperate the citation from the block quote. I understand now that a cite element is actually an inline type element. I changed it because having a footer here didn't make sense for styling. I changed it from a section, to a div because I was getting a warning when checking my code in validator.w3.org. Apparently sections need headers?-->
